# INSTALATION

This project uses CMake for building. A brief getting started guide for creating a build with CMake follows:

1. Make a new directory for storing the build;
2. cd into the directory;
3. Run cmake ..;
4. Run make;
5. Run the ./vk.

Refer to CMakeLists.txt for the build configuration and necessary dependencies.
